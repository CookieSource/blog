Welcome to my new blog. Iâ€™ll write about Linux, homelab, and random tinkering.

What to expect next:
- Short notes on fixes and gotchas
- Config snippets and dotfiles
- Lightweight self-hosting setups

Thanks for stopping by.

```bash
# simple bash demo
echo "hello from cookiesource"
uname -a
```

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello from cookiesource");
}
```
